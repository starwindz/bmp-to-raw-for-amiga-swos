Changes in the Ipswich Town Service Pack 1

   * Workaround for the gcc miscompile. This will ever so slightly reduce
     performance even when using a "good" gcc, so let's all fix our
     compilers, shall we, so that the workaround can be removed again!
   * Fixed some silly bugs Brian King found while porting to WinUAE. I
     especially like the one where gcc optimized away a NULL pointer
     dereference ;-)
   * Fixed some silly bugs I found when trying to find out why things
     wouldn't work for Brian
   * Add some code to support compilation without the REGPARAM stuff
     (essentially pushing/popping of function call arguments). This
     really is for debug builds only, DON'T USE IT FOR RELEASE STUFF!
   * Many many fixes in the DGA2 display driver. It's great to actually
     have a decent X server at last! Boy, had I screwed that one up....
   * Implemented new and hopefully glibc-independent way of handling
     the SIGSEGV handler. Anybody with glibc 2.2 out there who can
     test?
   * Added some code to attempt a graceful exit on soft-reset, rather
     than a hang/crash.
   * Handle a couple more instruction classes in the SEGV handler ---
     the MVMLE/MVMEL code was not covered.

New in Ipswich Town Release:

  * Ability to use PCI S3Virge cards in the host's PCI bus with the
    free CGX3 Virge drivers (see README.pci)
  * Completely overhauled the internal handling of compiled blocks. As
    a result, there is now
    - No more instruction cache thrashing. The "instruction cache" is now
      effectively fully associative, instead of direct mapped, as it used
      to be.
    - Soft cache flushing. This means that instead of throwing away all
      pretranslated code each time the 68k processor requests a cache
      flush, it just gets marked for having its checksum checked. If it
      matches, the compiled code is kept, and no recompilation is necessary
    - Improved inter-block dispatch code, giving significant speedups
    - Many 68k program counter updates could be saved
  * Integer registers can have "offset", optimizing pre-decrement and
    post-increment addressing
  * Aliasing for FPU registers
  * Lazy evaluation of FPU flags (combined with FPU register aliasing,
    this often reduces FPU flag generation overhead to 0)
  * cmov-free branch handling, giving speedup on cmov-less processors
  * More 68k instructions are JIT-emulated.
  * Compiling through unconditional branches is now optional
  * The optimizers are officially broken and abandoned ;-)
  * Bug fixes galore!
  * Much more that I can't remember right now.
  * In the MacOS Speedometer Benchmark Mix Average, UAE-JIT running
    Shapeshifter is now slightly faster than the Executor Demo, running
    on the same machine. Yeehaw ;-)

New in the Everton Release:

  * JIT compilation for FPU. Probably full of bugs, but damn, it is 
    fast ;-)
  * SIGSEGV handler for direct memory access. Obsoleting the
    comptrust* parameters, memory access should now always be direct
  * Configuration checks at runtime
  * Optimized block lookup code, giving up to 30% speedup
  * Native registers can now hold more than one virtual register.
    Avoids some pointless register moves, and thus gives a very slight
    speedup
  * Low level instruction optimizer. Currently broken :-(
  * Compiler functions are now allowed to fail at runtime (see compemu_fpp)
  * More precise timing code (decoupled the frame rate hack from vsync,
    and some changes in cia.c)
  * Bug fixes

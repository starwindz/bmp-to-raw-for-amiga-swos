National Team Update: World Cup 2010
v1.2 16/6/2010

Changes for v1.2:
- Julio Cesar de Leon injured for Honduras; replaced in squad

Changes for v1.1:
- Minor lineup changes and injured players Nani, Ferdinand, Mikel, Jones removed.

v1.0:
- Several non-qualifying nations are also included
- Player attributes/positions are derived from FM10 using my own algorithm
- SWOS doesn't understand squad numbers beyond 1-16, so as always I've only used 1-16 even if the real squad number might differ
- Players are labeled with their preferred position (rather than current lineup position) so that shuffling them around is viable, for example Gerrard is not labeled as a LW just because that's where he will probably start
- These teams are not intended to be used as part of a SWOS career mode and you may experience bugs if you attempt to use them in career mode

To install:
- Back up your current SWOS 'Data' folder
- Extract the files in this zip file to the 'Data' folder
- In SWOS, the teams are now available under National Teams as normal
